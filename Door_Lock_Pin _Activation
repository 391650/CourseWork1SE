Import RPi.GPIO as GPIO 
Import time
#The setmode line sets the way in which the pins are numbered, in my case the pin I chose to power the door lock device is Pin 26 for BCM numbered layout.
#There is also the board layout which could have been used but BCM is more suitable as its diagrams show which pins are the correct devices and or ground cables.
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
#GPIO setup.OUT sets up the PI to provide power to the door lock device.
GPIO.setup(26,GPIO.OUT)
try:
     while True:
	  GPIO.output(26,GPIO.HIGH)
	  print(‘RELAY 1 ON’)
	  time.sleep(10)
	  GPIO.output(26,GPIO.LOW)
	  Print(‘RELAY 1 OFF’)
#This code does not loop infinitely but instead releases the door lock for 1 second and then closes it after that second is up. 
	  Time.sleep(1)
	  GPIO.cleanup()
#This line of code cleanup makes sure no lingering variables are present such as the state of true of false which could break the code if it is ran consecutively
#Which means if you ran the code, the PI might save a variable as one thing but it needs to reset to the base value for this code to be reusable which it needs to be
Finally:
      GPIO.cleanup()
